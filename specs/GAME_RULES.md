# Entropy - Board Game Rules

## Game Setup

### Counter Bag
- **7 counters of each color** = 49 total counters
- Colors: red, green, yellow, blue, white, black, purple (×7 each)

### Starting the Game
1. Empty 7×7 board is prepared
2. All 49 counters (7 of each color) go in the bag
3. Chaos player draws the first counter (unseen)
4. Game begins with Chaos placing this first counter
5. Order then gets to slide any counter or pass

### Important Rules
- Order can move the just-placed counter immediately
- Counters move like chess rooks (straight lines, any distance)
- Cannot jump over occupied squares
- Order may pass instead of moving

## Player Roles

### Chaos Player
**Role:** Prevent Patterns

- Draw counters randomly from bag
- Place on any empty square
- Try to disrupt Order's plans
- Create awkward positions

### Order Player
**Role:** Create Patterns

- Slide any counter on the board
- Build palindromic sequences
- Can pass (skip turn)
- Maximize scoring opportunities

## Scoring System

### Pattern Recognition
A palindromic pattern reads the same forwards and backwards. Patterns are found in **complete horizontal and vertical lines only** (no diagonals, no partial patterns).

### Basic Scoring Examples
- **AA** - Two identical = **2 pts**
- **ABA** - Basic palindrome = **3 pts**
- **ABBA** - Nested patterns = **6 pts**

### Advanced Scoring
- Nested patterns within larger patterns also score
- Overlapping patterns each count separately
- Pattern length = base points (AA=2, ABA=3, ABBA=4, etc.)
- Example: **ABCBA** = 8 points (5 for ABCBA + 3 for BCB)

| ABCDCBA | Seven fully unique | 15 pts |

### Identical Patterns
| Pattern | Description | Points |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| AAA | Three identical | 7 pts |
| AAAA | Four identical | 16 pts |
| AAAAA | Five identical | 30 pts |
| AAAAAA | Six identical | 50 pts |
| AAAAAAA | Seven identical | 77 pts |

### Five-Length Patterns
| Pattern | Description | Points |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| AABAA | Five with inner pattern | 12 pts |
| ABABA | Five alternating | 14 pts |
| ABBBA | Five with double center | 12 pts |

### Six-Length Patterns
| Pattern | Description | Points |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| AABBAA | Six with double center | 16 pts |
| ABAABA | Six with pattern | 18 pts |
| ABBBBA | Six with triple center | 22 pts |
| ABCCBA | Six with double center | 12 pts |

### Seven-Length Patterns
| Pattern | Description | Points |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| AAABAAA | Seven with different center | 29 pts |
| AABABAA | Seven with complex inner | 25 pts |
| AABBBAA | Seven with triple center | 23 pts |
| AABCBAA | Seven with different centers | 19 pts |
| ABAAABA | Seven with inner identical | 25 pts |
| ABABABA | Seven alternating | 27 pts |
| ABACABA | Seven with different center | 21 pts |
| ABBABBA | Seven with inner pattern | 27 pts |
| ABBBBBA | Seven with quadruple center | 37 pts |
| ABBCBBA | Seven with different center | 19 pts |
| ABCACBA | Seven with inner pattern | 15 pts |
| ABCBCBA | Seven with alternating pattern | 21 pts |
| ABCCCBA | Seven with triple center | 19 pts |

### Scoring Notes
- Nested patterns within larger ones also count
- Overlapping patterns each score separately
- **Total: 30 possible palindromic patterns**

## Match Structure

### Complete Match
1. **Setup:** All 49 counters go in the bag, Chaos goes first
2. **Game 1:** Player A is Chaos, Player B is Order
3. **Game 2:** Player A is Order, Player B is Chaos (role reversal)
4. **Winner:** Highest total score across both games

### Typical Scores
- **Average:** ~75 points
- **Good:** 100+ points
- **Poor:** <50 points
- **Expert:** 120+ points

## Strategy Tips

### For Chaos
- Place counters to break forming patterns
- Create gaps that are hard to fill usefully
- Force Order to make awkward moves
- Consider remaining colors in the bag

### For Order
- Build toward multiple potential patterns
- Control the edges of the board
- Minimize empty spaces Chaos can exploit
- Sometimes passing is the best move
